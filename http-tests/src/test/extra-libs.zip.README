# extra-libs.zip

This zip file contains a jar file that is added to the testing classpath (via build.sbt). The jar file has a name with
non-ascii characters (to test against filename encoding issues). It was wrapped into a zip file to avoid issues with
tooling which cannot handle non-ascii characters in filenames (in this case, Scala Steward, but also other tools had
problems with this file).
